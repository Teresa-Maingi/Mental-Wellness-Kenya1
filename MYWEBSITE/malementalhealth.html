    <p>Statistics have determined that in the overall deaths caused by suicide, men have reported a larger number than women. An alarming percentage of men suffer from depression, anxiety and other related mental health conditions. In that percentage, just a small portion have spoken to someone about their mental health. If you ask them about it they will say that they feel “embarrassed” and “less manly” talking about said issues. We cannot really blame them for this because society has taught man that to have feelings is to be weak. However, if you feel like you’re not okay we are ready to help you with no judgement whatsoever. Please feel free to reach out to us.</p>
