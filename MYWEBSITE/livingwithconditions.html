    <h2>HOW TO DEAL WITH THE NEWS OF A DIFFICULT DIAGNOSIS</h2>
    <h3>Give Yourself Time to Absorb The News</h3>
    <p>Anger, fear, denial and anxiety are normal reactions when you get a difficult diagnosis but the important thing is that you process your emotions. It may take varying duration for different people but eventually a person reaches some level of acceptance regarding the diagnosis. Do not allow yourself to live in denial. </p>
    <h3>Create a Support System</h3>
    <p>The first instinct for many people, especially those who are used to being caregivers may be to hide the news because they do not want "to cause anyone unnecessary pain". However it's important to reach out to friends, family and even neighbours so that you don't end up feeling isolated.</p>
    <h3>Educate Yourself</h3>
    <p>Search reputable sources to get as much information as you can about your illness and your options. That knowledge allows you to have a two-way conversation with your doctor where you can discuss the pros and cons of your treatment options.</p>
    <h3>Take a Deep Breath and Look Ahead</h3>
    <p>Your life may feel different but if you work at it, you can find a balance.</p>
    <p style="background-color: darkgreen;">If you are finding it difficult to stay positive on most days or if the fear is preventing you from going through with treatment and putting a strain on your relationships it may be time to seek professional help.
