    <h2>HOW TO CONQUER SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND ADDICTION</h2>
    <h3>1.Wait to Respond</h3>
    <p>When something stressful happens to you, take a moment to breathe deeply and calm your mind. This is so that you can address the situation with level-headedness.</p>
    <h3>2.Mindfulness and Meditation</h3>
    <p>Use mindfulness and meditation techniques to work through emotions. This allows you to focus on the present moment, observe our internal experiences and to accept them without judgement or negativity.</p>
    <h3>3.Keep Busy</h3>
    <p>This is the time to do the things you've been putting off. Adapt a behaviour of keeping to-do-lists.</p>

    <p>Treat yourself to nutritious, satisfying meals and nourish your body with vitamins. Drink plenty of water too.</p>
