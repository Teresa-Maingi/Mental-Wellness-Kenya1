<h2>WAYS OF OVERCOMING NEGATIVE BODY IMAGE</h2>
<h3>A.Challenge Yor Negative Thoughts</h3>
<p>Pay attention to the self-talk you give your reflection in the mirror everyday. Come up with mantras and positive affirmations to say to yourself every morning.</p>
<br>
<h3>B.Focus On The Positive</h3>
<p>Start by writing things about your body that you're grateful for in your journal. Look inward and write the non-physical traits that you love about yourself. Think also about how you can begin to appreciate your not-so-favorite parts.</p>
<br>
<h3>C.Show Your Body Love</h3>
<p>Implement a routine that will help you keep your body healthy. Sleep for 8 hours, shower everyday, brush your teeth after meals, find your scent, groom nicely and most importantly, <b>eat healthy food</b></p>
<br>
<h3>D.Love What Your Body Does More than How It Looks</h3>
<p>There's so much that your body can do, learn to appreciate it all. It is helpful to journal all the things you appreciate about your body.</p>
<br>
<h3>E.Challenge Comparison And Media Potrayals</h3>
<p>The media sets standards for how our bodies should look but it is up to you to challenge those standards and stick to the body type you actually want to have.</p>
<br>
<h3>F.Set Healthy Boundaries</h3>
<p>This involves distancing yourself from things or people that make you insecure about your body. Go as far as deleting nad unfollowing social media accounts that make you feel bad about your body. </p>
